# Path-Visualizer-Project
Using My Data Structures and Algorithms Knowledge Previously I made a Path Visualizer which Basically find the shortest path (Manhattan Distance ) between two nodes in a grid inspite of having walls inbetween. I implemented the A* algorithm from scratch in python using priority queue data structures inbuilt in python. used pygame module to visualize the project.
